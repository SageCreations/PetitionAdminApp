# PetitionAdminApp
Admin app interface for my petition app


This front-end app is the front end for database entries. Only meant to be used by the person who set up the infrastructure. For outside users, refer to PetitionUserApp Repo. 
This front-end app also needs correct linkage to PetitionAPI to get access to the database. 
This front-end app only reads the database and is able to delete database entries.
